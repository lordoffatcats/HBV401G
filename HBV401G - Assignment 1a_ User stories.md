1. As a traveler, I want to view a list of day tours offered for booking with details (e.g. title, short description, duration, price), so that I can quickly see and compare my options.
2. As a traveler, I want to apply one or more filters (e.g. date, group size, category, duration, price), so that I can find day tours that match my constraints.
3. As a traveler, I want to sort the tour list by price or duration, in ascending or descending order, so that I can compare tours in the order most relevant to me.

5. As a traveler, I want to view tour details with key information (e.g. itinerary/description, inclusions, requirements, available start times, cancellation policy), so that I can confirm the details before booking.
6. As a traveler, I want to select a date/time and group size to book, so that I can reserve the correct tour for my group.
